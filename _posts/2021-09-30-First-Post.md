Today is a milestone for Victoria and myself, as Victoria overtakes NSW in daily COVID-19 cases and this is my first post at such a meaningful day.


Here's a useless table:

| New cases | cases number |
| :------ |:--- | 
| Acquired locally | 1,438 | 
| Acquired overseas | 0 | 
| Acquired interstate | 0 |
| Active cases | 11,018 |
