My name is Jinxin Zhao. 

Iâ€™m a computational biologist who is interested in bacterial pharmaco-omics(e.g., genomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, proteomics and microbiome) and pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics modelling in antimicrobial research. I usually use R in my work. I am trying to start off this online note from my first year of my postdoc.
