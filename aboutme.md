title: About me
subtitle: Research Fellow, Bioinformatician and Pharmacometrician @Monash University
---

I received my bachlor of Biological Sciences and master of Bioengineering from Shandong University, China, and PhD in Antimicrobial Systems Pharmacology from Monash University, Australia.

Iâ€™m a computational biologist who is interested in bacterial pharmaco-omics(e.g., genomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, proteomics and microbiome) and pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics modelling in antimicrobial research. I usually use R in my work. I am trying to start off this online note from my first year of my postdoc.
